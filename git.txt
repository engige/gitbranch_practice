Git Bash collaboration introduction:

1. **Bash Command Line Basics**:
   - **Bash Shell**: A command-line interface to interact with the operating system, especially on Unix-based systems like macOS.
   - **Basic Commands**: Learn to navigate directories using `cd`, create directories with `mkdir`, and verify the current location with `pwd`.
   - **File Management**: Commands like `nano` are used to create and edit files directly in the command line.

2. **Git Fundamentals**:
   - **Version Control with Git**: Git is a powerful version control system used globally for software development and collaboration.
   - **Essential Git Commands**:
     - `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
     - `git commit`: Record staged changes to the repository.
     - `git push`: Upload local commits to a remote repository.
     - `git merge`: Integrate changes from one branch into another.
     - `git branch`: Manage multiple lines of development.
     - `git checkout`: Switch between branches.
     - `git status`: Check the current state of the repository.
     - `git stash`: Temporarily store changes.
     - `git log`: View commit history.

These basics form the foundation for version control and command-line navigation that are critical for software developers.

The "Bash Shell" content:

1. **Bash Shell Overview**:
   - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Provides a low-level way to interact with your computer, bypassing the graphical interface.
   - **Navigation**: Learn to navigate directories and files using Bash shell commands, essential for programming and data science workflows.

2. **Basic Commands**:
   - **`pwd` (Print Working Directory)**: Displays your current directory.
   - **`cd` (Change Directory)**: Navigate through directories. Use `cd` to go home, `cd ..` to move up one level, or `cd ~/Documents` to access specific folders.
   - **`ls` (List Files)**: Lists all files in the current directory.

3. **Tab Completion**: Speeds up typing by automatically completing file and directory names.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - **Workflow Shortcuts**: `cmd+tab` for Mac and `alt+tab` for Windows to switch between applications quickly.
   - **Resources**: Links to further reading on bash commands for deeper understanding.

This lesson is designed to introduce basic Bash shell commands to help users navigate their file system and prepare for Git usage.

"Git Version Control 101" content:

1. **Purpose of Version Control**:
   - Version control allows tracking multiple versions of a project, enabling easy rollback to previous states.
   - It helps in collaboration, backup, and experimentation without risking the codebase.

2. **Advantages of Version Control**:
   - Facilitates easy reversion to a previous working version.
   - Acts as a backup for your work.
   - Enables collaboration by allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously.

3. **Types of Version Control Systems**:
   - **Local Version Control**: Stores all project data on a single local machine.
   - **Centralized Version Control**: Uses a server-based repository accessible by multiple users, though it requires network connectivity.
   - **Distributed Version Control**: Each user has a full copy of the repository and can work independently, pushing changes to a central server when needed.

4. **Introduction to Git**:
   - Git is a distributed version control system widely used in the industry.
   - Allows for independent work, merging changes, and keeping the full history of the project locally.

5. **GitHub**:
   - GitHub is a remote repository service built to work with Git, making it easy to collaborate and host projects online.

This lesson introduces version control concepts and why Git is a preferred tool for managing code in collaborative environments.
