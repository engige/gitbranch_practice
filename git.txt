Git Bash collaboration introduction:

1. **Bash Command Line Basics**:
   - **Bash Shell**: A command-line interface to interact with the operating system, especially on Unix-based systems like macOS.
   - **Basic Commands**: Learn to navigate directories using `cd`, create directories with `mkdir`, and verify the current location with `pwd`.
   - **File Management**: Commands like `nano` are used to create and edit files directly in the command line.

2. **Git Fundamentals**:
   - **Version Control with Git**: Git is a powerful version control system used globally for software development and collaboration.
   - **Essential Git Commands**:
     - `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
     - `git commit`: Record staged changes to the repository.
     - `git push`: Upload local commits to a remote repository.
     - `git merge`: Integrate changes from one branch into another.
     - `git branch`: Manage multiple lines of development.
     - `git checkout`: Switch between branches.
     - `git status`: Check the current state of the repository.
     - `git stash`: Temporarily store changes.
     - `git log`: View commit history.

These basics form the foundation for version control and command-line navigation that are critical for software developers.
